#ALLEGORIES

## The Allegory of the Rock
Your startup is a **rock rolling in a field**, the **speed represents the company’s growth rate** and the **size its valuation**. The growth of the diameter of the rock is achieved by the collisions with other rocks along the way. This process can also create erosion.

The **push from founders, investors and employees are the only forces applied to the system that moves the rock forward**, accelerating as per Newton’s Second Law. Nevertheless, we have to remember **inertia and friction**. Inertia is the pain to make things move in the beginning. 
Friction represents all growth obstacles, namely your **churn rate**.
